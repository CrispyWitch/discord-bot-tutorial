# Replicate Discord command

[Follow the instructions here to create an application in Discord.](https://discord-py-slash-command.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) You'll want to give it permissions to create messages.

Add your Discord app token and Replicate API key to `.env`:

    REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=...
    DISCORD_TOKEN=...

You'll also need an API key from Replicate.

Then, run the bot like this:

    poetry run python bot.py
